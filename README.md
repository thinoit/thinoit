### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not very good at introducing myself, but it's more polite to do so, let's do it !!

My first computer purchase was not a game, but a programming language. I have been programming since I was 15, over 36 years old. I started on an amiga 500 with 512KB of RAM which allowed me to get my hands on the code and drivers very quickly.

In professional computer engineering since 1995, I have worked for the largest systems in Europe, and some other countries in the word, in the telecom and the banking companies across more than 12 countries.

Senior analyst and senior developer, I am a full-stack developer in vms, unix, linux, c, C++, pl/sql, oracle, php, html5, css3, javascript, ...

The main quality of a developer is self-learning and technology watch and practice, in order to improve every day, in methodology and practice.

My credo, code optimization in performance and security. Propose easily scalable solutions ... basically think the project correctly before launching it ;)

The goal is to become a better version of myself by updating and upgrading knowledge and experience. ;)
